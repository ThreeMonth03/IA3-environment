"Planning a vacation can be both exciting and overwhelming. The process starts with the decision to take a trip. Once this is decided, the next critical step is to determine the budget, which plays a significant role in shaping the rest of the planning process.

If the budget is substantial, an international destination might be considered. If it's more modest, a local destination will likely be more suitable. Once the budget-driven choice is made, it's essential to research about the chosen destination, learning about local culture, must-visit places, and any potential safety issues.

This research phase might change one's perspective on the destination. If that happens, the process loops back to choosing a new destination. Otherwise, the plan proceeds to the booking phase.

Booking starts with flights. If flights are not available for the desired dates, the process will have to loop back to the choice of dates. Once flights are booked, it's time to look for accommodations. Unavailability of hotels can also trigger a loop back to adjust the dates or even reconsider the destination.

Next comes local transportation. If all aspects align - flights, hotel, and local transport, the trip is ready to be confirmed. Otherwise, necessary adjustments are made until all pieces fit together.","graph LR

"Building a house is a major undertaking. It starts with the decision to build a home, followed by choosing a suitable plot of land. Financing is the next crucial step, which if successful, leads to hiring an architect to draft the house plans.

If the architect's plan is approved, the process continues with hiring a contractor. Otherwise, the plan is revised until approval. Once a contractor is on board, they procure the necessary materials and start the construction.

During construction, inspections are held to ensure the building meets all the regulations. If any issues are identified during inspection, the construction halts, the issues are fixed, and a re-inspection is scheduled. If the inspection is passed, construction proceeds and eventually completes, allowing the proud homeowners to move in.","graph LR

"Adopting a pet is a rewarding experience that starts with the decision to add a new member to your family. The first step is to decide on the type of pet that suits your lifestyle and home environment.

Once the type of pet is chosen, it's essential to research the needs of that particular pet, including food, exercise, and healthcare requirements. If, after research, you feel confident about meeting the pet's needs, the next step is to find a shelter.

Visiting the shelter and interacting with potential pets is an emotional experience. If you connect with a pet, you proceed with the adoption process; if not, you might choose to visit other shelters or wait for new arrivals.

Once you have found the perfect pet, you go through the adoption process, and if successful, you bring your new family member home.","graph LR
